        Oreo bits, stuffed with a cookies and cream frosting and

        sound strange but this cookie is one not to be missed!

        I have made tens of thousands of cookies in my life! 
        Every kind of cookie, Brown Sugar Poptart cookies, Orange 
        Creamsicle cookies. When it comes to unique cookie recipes, 
        I am your source! So when Brad from Fat and Weird Cookies 
        reached out to me, I knew I had to try their cookies and 
        make a copycat.   
    </p>
    <p class="stdTextColor">
        Fat and Weird cookies have absolutely HUGE 1 pound cookies. 
        But it isn’t just their size that makes them different from 
        the pack! Fat and Weird lives up to their name with super 
        wacky but somehow perfect cookie flavors. Like this Dirty 
        Worm cookie! A brown sugar cookie Cookies and Cream cookie, 
        stuffed with white chocolate chips, Oreo pieces and filled 
        with a cookies and cream frosting and a gummy worm randomly 
        stuffed in there, and topped with teal sprinkles…because 
        everything is better with some sparkle!

    <h2 class="textColor1">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="stdTextColor">
        <li>Start by making the cookies and cream core. In a small 
            bowl using an electric hand mixer cream together the 
            shortening and butter until mixed thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Add the powdered sugar, vanilla and heavy cream. Mix 
            until combined and thick. If you need, you can add a 
            little bit more heavy cream to bring the frosting together. 
            You want it really thick.</li>
        <li>Fold in the chopped oreos.</li>
        <li>Portion the frosting out into 4 equal sized mounds. </li>
        <li>Place a gummy worm on the top of two of the mounds and then 
            take the remaining mounds and sandwich the gummy worm into 
            the center of the frosting core. </li>
        <li>Place the frosting cores in the freezer until needed.</li>
        <li>For the cookie dough, using a stand mixer or electric hand 
            mixer, cream together the butter, brown sugar and sugar until 
            light in color and fluffy in texture.</li>
        <li>Scrape the sides of the bowl and add in the egg and vanilla. 
            Mix until combined.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, baking powder and salt. Mix until the dough forms.</li>
        <li>Lastly, mix in the white chocolate chips and oreos until well combined.</li>
        <li>Split the dough into two halves.</li>
        <li>Flatten one half and then place a frozen frosting core in the 
            center of the dough and then wrap the dough around the frosting 
            core. Repeat with the second cookie.</li>
        <li>Dip and press the top part of the cookie dough into a bowl of 
            teal sprinkles and place on your cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Place the cookie dough in the freezer while you heat the oven.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 350° F. </li>
        <li>Once the oven has reached temperature, pull the cookies out 
            of the freezer and bake for 20-22 minutes.</li>
        <li>The cookie should keep the same shape pretty well, the bottom 
            will expand just slightly, but the final cookie should look 
            extremely round and fat.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookie to cool on the pan for 30 minutes before 
            cutting and serving.</li>
